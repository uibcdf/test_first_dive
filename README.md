Temporal repository to make a first dive

Hello, this is my first commit!

In order to update the files to git, you need to:

1.- Create or make the modifications in the file
2.- Use the command 'git add file_name' to register the file you created/modified to the repository
3.- Notify to collaborators with 'git commit -m "Commit message"'
4.- Send your created/modified files using 'git push'
